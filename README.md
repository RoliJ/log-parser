# Log Parser and Log Count API

This project consists of a console command and a REST API endpoint designed to parse a large log file and provide the count of rows that match specified filter criteria. The log file contains log lines from multiple microservices and can be very large, with almost 100 million lines. The primary goal of this project is to efficiently handle the large log file, extract relevant information, and insert the data into a database. Additionally, the API endpoint `/logs/count` accepts filter parameters via the GET HTTP verb and returns the count of rows matching the provided filters.

## Problem Description

As part of a larger system, a log file (`logs.txt`) containing log lines from various microservices is provided. The file is massive and contains nearly 100 million lines. The log file data structure is as follows:

```
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:21:53] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:21:54] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 422
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:21:55] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:21:56] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:21:57] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:22:58] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 201
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:22:59] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 422
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:23:53] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:23:54] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 422
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:23:55] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:26:51] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:26:53] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:29:10] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:29:13] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:30:54] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 422
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:31:55] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:31:56] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
invoice-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:26:53] "POST /invoices HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:32:56] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 201
order-service - [17/Sep/2022:10:33:59] "POST /orders HTTP/1.1" 422
```

The challenge is to process this log file efficiently and extract meaningful data from each line. The two main tasks are:

### Console Command: `log:parse`

Create a console command that parses the log file and inserts the extracted data into the database. The command should use a memory-efficient approach to process the file in chunks, allowing it to handle large files without running out of memory.

### Log Count API Endpoint: `/logs/count`

Design a REST API endpoint `/logs/count` that provides a count of rows in the database that match specified filter criteria. The API should accept filter parameters (`serviceNames`, `statusCode`, `startDate`, `endDate`) via the GET HTTP verb and return the count in a JSON response.

## Implementation Details

This project utilizes Laravel 10 and MySQL, following best practices for coding and adhering to the SOLID, KISS, DRY, YAGNI principles, design patterns, separation of concerns, and framework standards to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

### Memory-Efficient Approach

The log parser's memory-efficient approach has been improved by implementing chunked data read and insert using Laravel's Queue Jobs. Instead of processing the entire log file in one go, the log parser now reads the file in chunks, validates each line, and queues the processing of each chunk as a job. The queued jobs are then processed in the background using Laravel's queue workers, ensuring efficient memory utilization and the ability to handle large log files with ease.

### Filter Structure and Output Structure

The Log Count API endpoint `/logs/count` accepts the following filter parameters via the GET HTTP verb:

- `serviceNames`: An array of service names to filter the log count.
- `statusCode`: An integer representing the HTTP status code to filter the log count.
- `startDate`: A string representing the start date for the date range filter.
- `endDate`: A string representing the end date for the date range filter.

The API returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "count": 50
}
```

## Database Details

The chosen database for this project is MySQL, and the database name is `log_parser`. The schema for the `logs` table, where the parsed log data is stored, is as follows:

| Column Name         | Data Type   | Description                        |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| log_file_name       | VARCHAR     | The name of the log file           |
| file_last_updated_at| TIMESTAMP   | The last updated date of the file  |
| line_number         | INTEGER     | The line number of the log entry   |
| service_name        | VARCHAR     | The name of the microservice       |
| logged_at           | TIMESTAMP   | The timestamp of the log entry     |
| method              | VARCHAR     | The HTTP method of the request     |
| endpoint            | VARCHAR     | The API endpoint accessed          |
| protocol            | VARCHAR     | The HTTP protocol used             |
| status             

 | INTEGER     | The HTTP status code               |
| created_at          | TIMESTAMP   | The creation timestamp of the entry|
| updated_at          | TIMESTAMP   | The update timestamp of the entry  |
| deleted_at          | TIMESTAMP   | The soft delete timestamp          |

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the project from the `main` branch.

2. Install the required dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Run the database migrations to set up the required tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

4. Install Laravel Passport for authentication:

   ```bash
   php artisan passport:install
   ```

5. Create a personal access client:

   ```bash
   php artisan passport:client --personal
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. Run the queue worker to process the queued jobs:

   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work
   ```

8. To parse the log file (`logs.txt`) and insert the data into the database, use the following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan log:parse logs.txt
   ```

9. To access the Log Count API endpoint, register and log in, then send a GET request to `/logs/count` with the desired filter parameters in the query string.

## Feature Tests

The project includes three feature tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of key functionalities:

1. `AuthControllerTest`: This test validates the authentication process and ensures that users can register, log in, and access protected routes.

2. `ParseLogCommandTest`: This test verifies that the log parsing console command works as expected and correctly inserts the data into the database.

3. `LogControllerTest`: This test checks the functionality of the Log Count API endpoint and ensures that it returns the correct count based on the provided filter parameters.

## Documentation

The API documentation has been generated using the `rakutentech/laravel-request-docs` package. You can access the documentation by visiting the `/request-docs` route.

## Future Improvements

As part of future improvements, the following enhancements are planned:

- Improve the database structure to prevent data loss by inserting the whole line content into a JSON column and handling invalid lines separately in the `invalid_logs` table.

- Enhance the performance of file reading, database insertion, and API endpoint access to handle even larger log files efficiently.

- Strengthen the validation process for the log parser, including file-related, database-related, and API validations.

- Enhance error handling to provide more detailed and informative error messages to users.

- Improve the overall security of the application, leveraging the existing Laravel Passport authentication features.

- Implement additional test cases to further validate the log parser, API endpoint, and other components of the system.

- Dockerize the project for easy deployment and scalability.

- Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Notes and Comments

The security level of this application is deemed strong due to the integration of Laravel Passport for authentication and the robustness of the Laravel framework itself.
